Export the workbook in PDF format.
    Select File→Export and then select the Create PDF/XPS button.
    Note: Exporting is one of the ways Excel workbooks can be shared, which is why it is introduced here. You may be aware that you can save your file as a PDF or XPS document in the Save As dialog box. The only difference between these two methods is the title of the dialog box and the command to Save or Publish the file.
    In the Publish as PDF or XPS dialog box, verify that the Save as type selected is PDF (*.pdf), and select Options.
    In the Options dialog box, in the Publish what section, select Entire workbook, and select OK.
    Make sure that the Open file after publishing check box is checked.
    Select Publish.
    Note: If you see the How do you want to open this file? dialog box, you can select Edge to open the PDF if you don't have a program associated to open the PDF file.
    Scroll as needed to examine the PDF file.
    Many web browsers can display PDF files, and other PDF readers are freely available for a wide variety of devices, so PDF is a good format for sharing data in situations where users do not have access to Excel.
